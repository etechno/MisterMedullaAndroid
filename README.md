# MisterMedullaAndroid

Mister Medulla is an android game written in Kotlin. The objective of the game is to keep a set of body systems like heartbeat and breathing active through constant input. The game consists of a menu, tutorial, and game proper.

The application is drawn using the built-in types canvas and bitmaps. Several images are overlaid atop another, and scaled or cropped to display the various statuses of the player. All the artwork for this project was provided by Stetofire.
